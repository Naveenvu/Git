What is version control system?
A version control system is a software that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
It also allows you to work together with other programmers.


What is distributed version control system?
A distributed version control system  brings a local copy of the complete repository to every team member’s computer, so they can commit, branch, and merge locally.
The server doesn’t have to store a physical file for each branch — it just needs the differences between each commit
